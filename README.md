This application has been built as part of a recruitment process.

This is a simple application that will help to manage movies in a video store.
For now the app allows you to create new movies by title and to keep track of favorites of each of them.

Remember to run `npm install` at the very beggining to make sure that you have installed the dependencies correctly.
